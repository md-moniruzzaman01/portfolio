            <p className='my-5'>I've always loved technology. From a young age, technology has interested me. Most children play video games of some kind, from tetris to spyro, crash bandicoot to final fantasy, I loved playing with computers, but my interest didn't stop just at entertainment.

                The more I played, the more I wanted to understand how things worked. If something broke, I would take it apart and figure out what had gone wrong, trying to get it back to normal.

                I remember taking apart my computer when I was 12, an event which horrified my parents.

                I still build my own computers.

                I never lost my curiosity, but my interest in technologies changed as I expanded my knowledge from taking apart equipment to building new websites in code.

                Now I focus on people and learning how they interact with websites, making sure they can achieve their goals leaving them satisfied and more likely to return as customers.</p>
